# sensor monitor

This is a small background job that listen for sensor events on a mqtt queue provided by a ESP32 running Tasmota with a DS18B20 and a DHT11 attached, and reports the data to my [home environment monitor(hemrs)](https://github.com/Frixxie/hemrs) solution

The stack is implemented using Rust and Docker and runs within my private kubernetes cluster

* Mqtt broker
* Instance of hemrs
* Postgres

## How to build and run
